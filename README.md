# Ecological NLP Research Hub

This repository holds the architectural blueprint and implementation plan for an ecological, resource-aware NLP exploration system described through 12 research-focused web interfaces, plus a simplified resilient mode for snappy/guarded operations.

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` explains the guiding principles, layered architecture, interface mappings, and operational hooks that keep the UI and backend aligned.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` details storage, compute, governance, and monitoring decisions along with next steps toward building the stack.

Use this project as the foundation to assemble the React front-end, backend services, and orchestrations needed to operationalize the design. 

Refer to `SIMPLIFIED_RESILIENT_SYSTEM.md` for the pared-down, high-resilience variant that keeps only the snappy surfaces and energy guards.
